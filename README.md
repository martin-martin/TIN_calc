# GIS Topology Math

contains some python code that recreates basic GIS topology calculations (as e.g. performed in ArcGIS)

### Growing list:
- vector slope calculations: Triangular Irregular Networks (GIS vector way of representing elevation) 
  - TODO: expand and modularize
- raster slope calculations
  - normalized weighting and sqrt(2) weighting
- conversion between radians and degrees
- conversion between orbit and meters
